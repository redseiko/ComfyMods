# DyeHard

Change your player hair color using RGB values or HTML color codes.

You will need a configuration manager to be able to change your hair-color in-game.
Usually there is one included with BepInEx, otherwise you can download one of the following.

  * Configuration Manager (Valheim-themed)
    * NexusMods: https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/740

  * BepInEx.ConfigurationManager (default)
    * GitHub: https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager/releases/tag/v16.3

# Instructions

  1. Unzip `DyeHard.dll` to your `/Valheim/BepInEx/plugins/` folder.
  2. In-game press `F1` to bring up the ConfigurationManager and navigate to `DyeHard`.
  3. Adjust your hair color using the RGB sliders or by entering in an HTML color code in hex form.
