### Creator Shop Functionality

  * Player may only break down creator shop places they have placed themselves.
  * This is to ensure world generated items cannot be broken down for mats farming.
  * World generated pieces will drop the same vanilla material drop table when broken with attacks/damage.

### Changing the ArmorStand pose

  * The new ArmorStands have 15 different poses available!
  * There is a `Change Pose` switch at the base of the stand.
  * PotteryBarn fixes the error that prevents changing poses in vanilla.
