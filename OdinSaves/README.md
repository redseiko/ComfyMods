# OdinSaves

*Saves your player profile more often.*

## Features

### PlayerProfile Saving

  * Your game will now save your character more often!
  * This means less annoyances if you crash or bug out!
  * Defaults to saving every 300s, configurable! (Game default and maximum is every 1200s).
  * Saves your current position as your logout point (defaults to true).
  * Shows a message when saving (also configurable).

### MapData Compression

  * Compress the map data (using vanilla compression) of other worlds you have visited.
  * Enable this feature with the `enableMapDataCompression` config option (restart required).
  * Note: **this is a non-reversible** process.
