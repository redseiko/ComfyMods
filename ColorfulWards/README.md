# ColorfulWards

  * You can color the glow effect of any ward using RGB and HTML color codes!
  * Those without the mod installed will still see the default yellow glow.

## Instructions

### Changing ward glow effect color

  * In-game, press `F1` to bring up the ConfigurationManager and navigate to the ColorfulWards section.
    * Change the target color using the RGB sliders or using an HTML color code.

  - Hover over any ward **that you are the owner of** and a prompt to change its color will appear.
    - This prompt can be hidden by disabling the `showChangeColorHoverText` setting.

  * Hit `LeftShift + E` (configurable) to change the color of the ward glow effect.

### Ward vertical radius

  * **Wards will now only extend/cover its default radius (30m) on the vertical/Y axis.**
    * Can be toggled on/off in configuration options.
  * In the vanilla game, the range is infinite on the Y axis and the default radius on the XZ axis.
